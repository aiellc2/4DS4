Exercise 2

This exercise was based on experiment 3b and uses two interrupts based on switch groups A and B.
The sixteen last-toggled switches are recorded in a 16 element array, where elements are shifted through the array as new
values are added. Eventually the older values are overwritted. When necessary, the history array is searched to find the
smallest and largest values. The two largest values are shown on the LCD when SW16 is toggled up. The 3 largest and smallest
values are printed in the console when SW16 is switched down.
